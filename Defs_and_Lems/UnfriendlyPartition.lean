# Shared definitions for the Unfriendly Partition Conjecture

Vocabulary shared by the plain conjecture (`challenge_10_univ`,
`challenge_10_disprove`) and the parametrized `r`-partitioning game
(`challenge_10`).

A side assignment is a function `f : V → σ`. `neighboursInSide` and
`UnfriendlyAt` are generic in `σ`, with `sideVal : Bool → σ` embedding the two
sides:

* the plain conjecture uses **total** partitions `f : V → Bool` with
  `sideVal = id`;
* the game uses **partial** partitions `f : V → Option Bool` with
  `sideVal = some` (so `f y = some b` selects side `b`, and the `∃ b, f x = some b`
  clause of `UnfriendlyAt` additionally witnesses that `x` is assigned).

Neighbourhood sizes are compared by **injections**, so vertices of infinite
degree are handled correctly.

/-- A partition is unfriendly at `x` when `x` has at least as many neighbours in
the opposite class as in its own. `sideVal` embeds the two `Bool` sides into the
assignment codomain `σ` (`id` for a total `V → Bool` partition, `some` for a
partial `V → Option Bool` one); the `∃ b, f x = sideVal b` clause also records
that `x` is assigned a side. -/

/-- A partition that assigns every vertex a side and is unfriendly at every
vertex.  The first conjunct is totality: for `sideVal = id` (a total
`V → Bool` partition) it is automatic, and for `sideVal = some` (a partial
`V → Option Bool` partition) it is `IsPartition f`. -/
