# Excluded Minors of GF(pᵐ)-representable Matroids — Universal Statement

For every prime power `r = pᵐ`, characterize the excluded minors for
representability over the finite field `GF(pᵐ)`.

For `r = 2` (binary matroids), the only excluded minor is `U₂,₄` (Tutte 1958).
For `r = 3` (ternary matroids), the excluded minors are `U₂,₅`, `U₃,₅`, `F₇`,
and `F₇*` (Reid; Bixby; Seymour).

This universal version asserts that a complete finite excluded-minor list
exists for EVERY prime-power field size — that is, Rota's conjecture, proved
by Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle.

`L` is a complete list of excluded minors for GF(pᵐ)-representability:

* `L` is finite;
* every member of `L` is a finite matroid which is an excluded minor for
  GF(pᵐ)-representability;
* no two distinct members of `L` are isomorphic; and
* every finite matroid that is not GF(pᵐ)-representable has a minor
  isomorphic to a member of `L` (`≤i` is the iso-minor relation).

Members of `L` are matroids with ground sets in `ℕ`; matroids over an
arbitrary type are compared against `L` up to isomorphism.
