Ryser's hypergraph conjecture for the chosen `r` (with `2 ≤ r`):
every `r`-partite `r`-uniform hypergraph satisfies
`coverNumber <= (r - 1) * matchingNumber`, where the cover number `τ` is the
least size of a vertex cover and the matching number `ν` is the largest size
of a matching (canonical `sInf`/`sSup` values over the achievable sizes).

For `r = 2` this is a classical theorem of König, and for `r = 3` it was
proved by Aharoni. The hypothesis `2 <= r` is necessary: for `r = 1` the
bound reads `tau <= 0`, which already fails for the single-vertex
single-edge hypergraph (where `tau = nu = 1`).

Under the `IsUniform`/`IsPartite` hypotheses (with `2 <= r`) both invariants
are attained: the vertex set is a cover (each edge meets part `0`), and the
empty matching plus the powerset bound make the matching-size set nonempty
and bounded. So the statement below coincides with the witness-level
phrasing about minimum covers and maximum matchings.
